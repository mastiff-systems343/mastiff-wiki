# What does Mastiff do?
  
We are a small IT services company that provides very personal and in-depth support to small businesses. We have specialized knowledge in the dental space so you will see a lot of dental clients.

We want to serve the needs of the business rather than let the technology dictate. 

We are ONLY here to help these companies succeed. We will help them use technology as a competitive advantage rather than something they have to put up with.

We are the best of the best server admins. We work hard to never disrupt a customer and our servers are bullet proof.

# Principles

Mission statements are usually written by lawyers and are drab and boring. Here are a few principles that are worth thinking about. 

#1 **Listen more than you talk.** Listen just to listen, without any intention of replying. Listen deeply to what people are saying, not just their words. Listen to your inner voice and body. Listen as empathetically as possible.

#2 **Slow down and really think.** Once you have listened and fully understand the situation as best as possible only then should you make a plan of action. When there is chaos stopping what you are doing, taking a deep breath, and keeping a cool head is the best course of action.

#3 **Be honest no matter what.** If something goes wrong, even something big. Stop what you are doing and think. Take a deep breath and assess the situation rather than react. Once you fully understand the situation reach out to who can help and come up with a plan to solve the issue. This can all happen in under ten minutes. Then tell the client the truth as tactfully as possible and how it will be resolved. Always set proper expectations. Honesty and good communication can solve most issues. 

#4 **We believe in fully remote work.** We want to work with the best people wherever they are. We got rid of any office space we had and only rented rooms for servers in data centers. When I thought through years ago how I wanted the company to work I wrote “Fully decentralized workforce” and Covid proved how well that could work. 

**#5 We use tools to run the business that we can self host and control the data.** We want full digital sovereignty and believe in open source. We use open formats and products that we can fully control. We are the server people, we should be able to self host out entire business stack.

**#6 We believe strongly in work-life balance.** The work we do is chaotic. When a client is down we work night and day until they are up. But that is the EXCEPTION, not the rule and hopefully, this is a rare occurrence. One of the many reasons we use Basecamp specifically is the focus mode. Where you can turn off alerts and get to work. Sometimes that's not possible and you need to be reachable. But constant distractions don’t help anyone. We want well-rounded people working here. When you aren’t working, disconnect. Unless it’s the rare time we are in crisis mode and it’s all hands on deck, don’t reply to emails when you are not working. Enjoy your friends and family. Take a walk, read a great book. Breathe life in and enjoy. Don’t be thinking about whatever problem you need to solve for Mastiff. Get a good night's sleep, then when you do work, you can be more focused because of the divide. Three to four hours of real focused work a day is better than twelve unfocused and half-assed.

**#7 We are not a family.** This ties into the last point. Companies that say that are lying. Your family is your family, not your coworkers. Companies tell employees this to keep them at work grinding late at night when they don’t need to be. Hopefully, you can be great friends with your coworkers as you usually spend more time with them than your family, but this makes family time even more important. We truly want every employee to have a great personal life and make enough money to not struggle. But other than that it's none of our business.

# Current company goals

#1 To get all the information centralized. Passwords, licenses, tickets, network maps. The company is completely disorganized with information all over the place now because there aren’t enough hours in the day.

#2 To get systems in place so we can be proactive with clients.

#3 Get everything running like a well-oiled machine, from accounting, to support, to billing. 

#4 To have the company run without Chris.

#5 ~~Get IT systems in better shape. Get a proper RIMM tool and monitor updates~~. 

#6 Become a holding company.
